        <h3>One of the most romantic and inspiring story in the history of mathematics:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887 in the town of Erode, located in Tamil Nadu.</li>
            <li>In 1904 Ramanujan left high school, his future looked promising and he had won the schoolâ€™s mathematics prize and, more importantly, a scholarship allowing him to study at the Government Arts College in the town of Kumbakonam.</li>
            <li>At the beginning of 1907, at the age of 19, with minimal funds and a stomach all too often groaning with hunger, Ramanujan continued on the path he had chosen: total devotion to mathematics</li>
            <li>He is recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians of his time, but Srinivasa Ramanujan had almost no formal training in math.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>"An equation means nothing to me unless it expresses a thought of God."</i></p>
        <p><i>"I had never seen anything in the least like them before. A single look at them is enough to show that they could only be written by a mathematician of the highest class. They must be true because, if they were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them."
